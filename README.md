# Hangman

This is the classic Hangman game. It was created as a part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum. 

## How to Play

## Features

* The ability to save your game at any time.
* The ability to load your game when gameplay begins.
* Colorized text provided by the Ruby Gem Colorized.
* Displayed strings turn green or red depending on if you're right or wrong.
* A visible hangman display that builds our hangman each time the player guesses incorrectly.

## Reflection

This was my first project where I applied OOP principles to my code in a comprehensive way.
I spent most of the time on this project refactoring so that my code conformed to OOP design 
principles. It was the most I've spent refactoring on any program to date and it was worth it. 
This was also the first time working with File I/O serialization in Ruby. I used YAML to serialize 
my files.I learned a lot writing this program and will be revisiting some older code to apply 
what I've learned here.
